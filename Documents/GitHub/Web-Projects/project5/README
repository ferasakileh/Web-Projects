Project Description:

    The objective of the calculator project is to create a calculator application with the following computational capabilities:

        General Arithmetic (addition, subtraction multiplication, division)
        Trigonometry Functions (sine, cosine, tangent)
        Exponential Calculation
        Modulo Calculation
        Factorial Calculation
        Percentage Calculation
        Logarithmic Calculation
        Square and Cubic Roots of Numbers
        Absolute Value Calculation
        List Analysis Capability (median, mode, min, max, mean)
        Decimal to Binary Conversion
        Decimal to Octal Conversion
        Decimal to Hex Conversion
        Fahrenheit to Celsius Conversion
        Generating odd numbers to a user specified limit
        Generating even numbers to a user specified limit
        Generating prime numbers to a user specified limit
        Generate Fibonacci numbers to a user specified limit
        Generate square numbers to a user specified limit

    The project was coded using JavaScript and HTML. To run the calculator, we have been using "npx serve" to run the project. 
    The project consists of three main files that support the calculator:
        
        calc.html
            This file contains the HTML that creates the layout for our calculator. It holds all of the buttons and the box that displays calculations.

        holder.js
            This file is the main driver of our code. It is where are three main helper functions, tokenizer.js, parser.js, 
            function_evaluator.js, and input_validator.js, get called. This file takes the input string after the user hits the
            "=" button, check the input's syntax to ensure it is valid, tokenizes it, parses it, then evaluates each function/operation.

        methods.js
            This file contains the methods that do the heavy lifting and calculations. All of the necessary features of the calculator are in this file. 

Methods:

    def is_input_valid
        This function checks a string and makes sure it is valid input for the calculator.

    def parentheses_balanced
        This function ensures that the user input has a valid amount of parentheses and that every parentheses expression is properly closed. 

    def valid_operators
        This function checks that the input string includes valid operators and ensures that there are no violations of the rules of mathematics. 

    def to_binary
        This function takes in a value and converts it to binary.

    def to_octal
        This function takes in a value and converts it to octal.

    def to_hex
        This function takes in a value and converts it to hex.

    def mean
        This function takes in a list of numbers and returns the average of all the elements. 

    def maximum
        This function takes in a list of numbers and returns the maximum value in the set.

    def fibonacci
        This function takes in a value (limit) and generates fibonacci numbers up to the user specified limit. 

    def F_to_C
        This function takes in a temperature value and converts it from fahrenheit to celsius.

    def factorial
        This function takes in a non-negative integer and returns the factorial of it.

    def percentage
        This function takes in two values, a and b. It calculates what percentage a is of b and then returns that percentage.

    def median
        This function takes in a list of numbers and returns the median of the list.

    def is_prime
        This function takes in a value and checks if it is a prime number. If it is, it returns true and false otherwise. 

    def generate_primes
        This function takes in a user specified value (limit) and generates all prime numbers up until that number.

    def log
        This function takes in two values, base and a and then returns the logarithm of a with the specified base.

    def square_root
        This function takes in a value and returns its square root.

    def cube_root
        This function takes in a value and returns its cubic root.
    
    def exponent
        This function takes in two values and returns the first number raised to the power of the second number. 

    def sine  
        This function returns the sine of a user specified value. 

    def cosine
        This function returns the cosine of a user specified value. 

    def tangent
        This function returns the tangent of a user specified value. 

    def find_smallest
        This function takes in a list of numbers and returns the smallest value from that set.

    def generate_squares
        This function takes in a user specified value (limit) and generates all square numbers up until that number.

    def generate_odd_numbers
        This function takes in a user specified value (limit) and generates all odd numbers up until that number.

    def generate_even_numbers
        This function takes in a user specified value (limit) and generates all even numbers up until that number.

    def mode
        This function takes in a list of numbers and returns the mode value from that set.
