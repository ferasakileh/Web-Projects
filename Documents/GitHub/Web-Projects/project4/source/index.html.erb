            <h3>Assistant Professor</h3>
            <p>I am an assistant professor in the computer science and engineering department at the Ohio State University. 
                I am broadly interested in designing intelligent data-driven algorithms for current and emerging networking 
                and distributed systems. In particular, I am interested in fundamental questions at the networking layer of 
                blockchains and emerging large scale decentralized applications. I enjoy problems that warrant 'first-principles' 
                thinking. Some of the other topics I have worked on in the past include scheduling algorithms for data center networks, 
                peer-to-peer networks and information theory.Prior to my current position I was a postdoc in the networks and 
                mobile systems group at MIT, where I worked on exciting problems in the intersection of network systems, algorithms 
                and theory. I received my PhD from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in 2017. I did my bachelor's 
                degree at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in 2012. During the summer of 2016 I interned at Google, where 
                I worked on congestion control in Google's data center networks. I was a recipient of the Joan and Lalit Bahl fellowship at UIUC. </p>
